# HW3 - Automated Testing for Team Project 2

## Project Description

This project, HW3, is part of a series of assignments for CSE360, focusing on automated testing. It involves designing, creating, testing, and documenting five automated test cases from our team's previous submission (Team Project 2). The goal is to produce professional-looking Javadoc documentation and demonstrate the implementation and results of the automated tests through a screencast.

## Features

- **Automated Test Cases**: Five custom automated test cases derived from Team Project 2.
- located in /src/test
- **Javadoc Documentation**: Professional-looking Javadoc output for the HW3 application.
- located in /doc
- **Screencast**: A video demonstrating the implementation, functionality, and results of the automated tests.

Functionality and output of the Javadoc documentation.
Results of running the automated tests.
You can access the screencast here.

Javadoc Documentation
Our source of inspiration for professional-looking Javadoc documentation can be found here. The Javadoc output for HW3 is included in the doc directory of the repository.

Automated Test Cases
The five automated tests are listed and described in the PDF provided. Each test case includes a short description and the results of running the tests.
